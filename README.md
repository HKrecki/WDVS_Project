Project carried out as part of the sensory data visualization course.
Topic: Weather Data Visualization Station.
Main assumptions: Implementation of a sensor network to monitor weather conditions. Readable parameters: temperature, insolation, humidity, precipitation, atmospheric pressure.
Components and technologies: 
Arduino + analog sensors (thermometer, photoresistor, humidity sensor, precipitation sensor, barometer) + visualization (C++ and Qt library)
